# Job Map

Job Map is an application used to find jobs in a specified area combined with a Map, to give the user a visual layout of their search.

## Motivation

On most job search sites, the user is given results matching their search but nothing more accurate than what city it is in. Job Map aims to show the user exactly where their potential future employers are on a map.

## Usage

Given a job title and city to search in, Job Map will show the user their search results.
